git-dit library - the distributed issue tracker for git library

**WARNING: This is pre-1.0! Expect bugs and incompatibilities!**

# git-dit features

* Distributed issue tracking, without checking files into the repository
* No structured data 
  * An issue/comment is a commit
  * "Tags" are supported (see `man git-interpret-trailers`)
* No additional software needed on the server-side.

When playing with this, please keep in mind that this is alpha quality - there
are bugs, missing things and rough edges.
